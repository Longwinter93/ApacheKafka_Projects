# Apache Kafka
***Apache Kafka*** is a distributed data store optimized for ingesting and processing streaming data in real-time.
Streaming data is data that is continiously generated by thousands of data sources, which typically send the data records in simultaneously.

In this repository there is only one simple a [ApacheKafka_Project1](https://github.com/Longwinter93/ApacheKafka_Projects/tree/main/ApacheKafka_Project1) project where processing streaming data in real-time happens.
